    <h1>Archy/Qichy --> My Fursona!</h1>
    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>This is my fursona. You can call me Archy or Qichy when I appear like them.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Archy</em> was originally what I named myself when I started learning English at five years old.</li>
      <li><em>Qichy</em> is like a cuter version of the translated name in Mandarin, much like the way family members call their young children at home if it were a Chinese name.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I like them. And I think they are <strong>really</strong> cute!</p>
    <p>Some elements here contribute to the cuteness of them (if not all): </p>
    <ol>
      <li>It is a bunny. And I LOVE bunnies.</li>
      <li>It is a bunny under a cloak. I just can't resist the combination of serious magic and childish dream. </li>
      <li>It is a bunny under a cat-like cloak, which is the BEST. They pretended to be a black cat as if nobody would find out the truth. What else can I say? For me bunnies and kitties are the most adorable things in the world!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>That being said, I've used the name Archy_notBunny or the abbreviation Archynb on many <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/21064259?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0" title="Bilibili Homepage" target="_blank">profiles</a> to tell people that I'm not a bunny uwu!</p>
